## 👋 Hi! I’m Milton — a developer who enjoys building practical, efficient tools that solve real problems.
I’m always learning, experimenting, and improving my workflow, especially when it comes to clean architectures, productivity, and simple-yet-effective solutions.

Over time, I’ve collaborated on several external projects, including:

- 🔍 Price lookup tools for fast and reliable data checking.
- ⭐ Rating/qualification systems for validating information at scale.
- 📄 Delivery log (fojas) control tools to support day-to-day operational workflows.
- 🧩 A web interface for an ERP, contributing to design, functionality, and user experience.

I enjoy turning ideas into working software, keeping things clear, maintainable, and real-world focused.
🚀 Always open to learning more, improving, and collaborating on interesting projects.
